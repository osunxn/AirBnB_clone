## 0x01 Introduction

Team project to build a clone of [AirBnB](https://www.airbnb.com/).

The console is a command interpreter to manage objects abstraction between objects and how they are stored.

To see the fundamental background of the project visit the [Wiki](https://github.com/ralexrivero/AirBnB_clone/wiki).

The console will perform the following tasks:

* create a new object
* retrieve an object from a file
* do operations on objects
* destroy an object

### Storage

All the classes are handled by the `Storage` engine in the `FileStorage` Class.
